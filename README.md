<h1>About the Course</h1>
<p>Databases are the standard method for using dynamic information in modern technologies, making them an integral part
    of almost every application. The intensive course on the basics of databases will introduce students to one of the
    most widely used database management systems (DBMS) in the development of modern information systems - PostgreSQL.
    The course pays serious attention to the relational model, ER diagrams (tables and relational links), and working
    with the SQL language (data retrieval, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion,
    and insertion). Fundamental knowledge is provided for working with functions, procedures, transactions, and
    triggers. This course lays the foundations for working with databases, making their use in real applications easier
    and understanding concepts such as converting a database to an object-oriented model (ORM).</p>
